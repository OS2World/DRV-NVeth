  This is a driver for NVIDIA family integrated LAN adapters.
  This driver is based up linux forcedeth driver and is supposed to support the
same scope of adapters.
  The installation is very simple - just unpack this archive into your 
IBMCOM\MACS directory and, mpts.exe and set up driver as any other network
driver. Then reboot.

Switches
________

There are several protocol.ini switches you can tune the driver work:

MODE - the speed to work on, see nvth.nif for details

OPTIMIZE - there are two modes of driver work - with throughput optimization
  and without, which results in different set of interrupts to enable. 
  This modes came from forcedeth linux sources and you can study the sources 
  for more info. I do not have the hardware to test the driver, 
  so its you to try which setting suits best for you.

TIMER - nvidia adapters have special interrupt driven by its own internal timer. 
  This switch enables or disables the use of this interrupt. 
  Switching off the timer will reduce the number of interrupts generating by 
  the driver thus lowering system load, but it also could increase the latency 
  in processing the rx/tx queues. Its up to you to find out whats is the best.

LINK_TIMER - if set to "YES", driver periodically queries HW chip for the 
  actual link speed and resetup the chip according to it.

RXCHAIN - the os/2 ndis drivers has two methods to pass received data to the 
  protocol drivers (tcpip and others) - receive chain and receive lookahead. 
  The first one should be better. This option was introduced for testing 
  purposes, now driver seems to work fine in both ways, so you can safely 
  leave the switch intact.

Bugs
____

  You tell me. I dont even have the NVIDIA hardware ;)
  All i know, not all PHY chips work with this driver. At least there are 
problems with some Vitesse PHYs.

your email provider accepts mail from mail.ru. Dont forget to include into 
your bugreports the model of your mainboad, model of your phy chip, pci.exe
output. If it traps, please, include trap screen. If you familiar with debug
kernels, include also db ds:0 ldf4 and other magic output you feel will be 
useful.

 Thanks to Ruediger Ihle for RM code, explanations and testing.
 Thanks to all those brave guys who tested it.

Changelog
_________

0.0.1
  Initial release, full of bugs.

0.0.2
  nveth.sys renamed to nveth.os2.
  Fixed bug with nforce1 adapter recognition.
  Compatibility fix for acpi's internal oemhlp$ driver.
  Added RM support.

0.0.3
  Added support for promiscous mode.

0.0.4
  Added extended description for switches in readme.
  Fixed trap in OS2KRNL due to accident block during interrupt processing.

0.0.5
? Untested fix to load multiple driver instances for several nvidia NIC's on same machine.
    Unfortunatelly, the only tester with dual nvidia nic has his MB broken 
    (not by this driver, by screwdriver, so dont worry ;)). So i have no 
    hardware to test it on, but i hope, you have it! Please, test and report.

0.0.6
  Added support for newer NVIDIA chipsets (MCP73, MCP77, MCP79, MCP89).
  Added PHY initialization for some Realtek & Vitesse products.
